Job Details

Summary
I’m working with an Excel dataset containing 50 rows. There are missing country and year founded information. 
I also have a separate reference company table that may help fill in some of the missing values.

For someone experienced with Python (Pandas) or similar data tools, the first part—auto-filling based on the reference table—should be relatively quick. 

You’re welcome to use pandas, GPT, or any other tooling you prefer. I’d like to review the code used to ensure accuracy and reproducibility.
